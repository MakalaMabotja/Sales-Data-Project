Project Overview
The Optimizing Sales Function with Data Science project is a comprehensive data science initiative aimed at enhancing the sales strategies and operational efficiency of businesses. This project was developed to address crucial aspects of the sales process, including customer segmentation, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis, and sales forecasting. By leveraging advanced data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project offers actionable insights to boost sales performance and customer satisfaction.

Project Objectives
Customer Segmentation: Employed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) clustering using Kmeans to group customers effectively for targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis: Utilized the Lifetimes library and Beta-Geo models to predict future purchases and calculate CLV, identifying high-value customer segments and enabling tailored retention strategies.

Sales Forecasting: Implemented and tested various time series models, including ARIMA and ETS, to predict future sales accurately. Feature engineering and transformation techniques were applied to optimize model performance.

Workflow and Project Structure
The project is organized into distinct sections, each implemented in separate Jupyter Notebook files:

1. Data Cleaning and Sales EDA:
Explored the dataset's structure and performed data cleaning to prepare it for analysis.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends and determine the necessary data wrangling for subsequent analyses.
Identified patterns and outliers crucial for RFM clustering, CLV analysis, and sales forecasting.

2. RFM Modeling and Cluster Analysis:
Implemented RFM clustering using Kmeans, optimizing the model through feature engineering and testing.
Conducted further EDA on sales trends within each cluster and analyzed product-specific behaviors within clusters.

3. CLV Forecasting per Cluster:
Forecasted future customer lifetime sales using Lifetimes library and Beta-Geo models for each customer cluster.
Developed strategies based on CLV insights to enhance customer engagement and loyalty programs.

4. Sales Forecasting with Time Series Models:
Explored various time series models (ARIMA, ETS) for sales forecasting, testing each model's performance.
Applied advanced feature engineering and transformation techniques to optimize the accuracy of sales forecasts.
